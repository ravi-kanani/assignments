Write a java program that can maintain a list of items. It will display a menu with the functionality to Add an item, and Display All Items (sorted in ascending order by price), and of course Exit.

An Item is an abstract class that maintains a valid price (cannot be a negative number) and a unique id that is autoincremented for each item.

A Book is an Item, it inherits Item. A book has an author name and title.

A GiftCard is an Item, it inherits Item. A GiftCard has a description and a colour (both strings).

Requirements: Code the files Item.java, Book.java, GiftCard.java and ShoppingCart.java files. (The Shopping Cart class maintains a list of Items of course!). You may need an additional class ShoppingCartApp.java to instantiate the shopping cart and contains the main method.

Draw the UML Class and Sequence diagrams using a UML tool of your choice. (draw.io is such a free tool).

Create a scriptfile using the script command to test and execute the program.

Submit the following: PDF file containing the UML class and sequence diagrams of your program AND submit the 4 or 5 java files for your program, AND submit the script file that shows the compilation and execution steps of your program. Do not compress/archive your files, simply attach all the files one by one and submit them in one attempt.

Please make sure your java programs are fully documented and use javadoc notation as much as possible.
